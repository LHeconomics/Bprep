  abstract = "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Split-dose bowel preparation for colonoscopy
              results in superior preparation quality. However, some endoscopy
              units remain hesitant to prescribe split-dose preparation given
              theoretical concerns about possible aspiration caused by gastric
              residual fluid when a second dose is given close to the time of
              endoscopy. Our aim was to compare gastric residual volume (GRV)
              in patients taking split-dose bowel preparation and those taking
              preparation the evening before colonoscopy. METHODS: We performed
              a prospective observational comparison of GRV among random
              inpatients undergoing same-day EGD and colonoscopy either after a
              split-dose bowel preparation or after a bowel preparation the
              prior evening. RESULTS: GRV was measured in 150 patients
              undergoing EGD and colonoscopy: 75 who completed a split-dose
              bowel preparation 2 to 3 hours before endoscopy and 75 who
              completed the bowel preparation regimen the prior evening. The
              mean GRV 2 to 3 hours after the last ingestion of bowel
              preparation among split-dose group patients was 21 $\pm$ 24 mL
              ($\pm$ standard deviation; range, 0 to 125 mL), which was not
              different from the mean GRV of 24 $\pm$ 22 mL (range, 0 to 135
              mL) in patients who ingested the preparation the prior evening (P
              = .08). GRV had no association with the presence of diabetes,
              gastroparesis, or opioid use. CONCLUSIONS: GRV is the same after
              a split preparation and fasting for 2 to 3 hours or after
              preparation with overnight fasting. The data suggest that the
              risk of aspiration is identical after either preparation
              technique and thus that sedation for colonoscopy can be performed
              safely 2 hours after bowel preparation ingestion.",

              preparations-poor bowel preparations can increase medical costs,
              rates of missed lesions, and procedure duration. The combination
              of polyethylene glycol (PEG) 3350 without electrolytes (MiraLAX;
              Schering-Plough Healthcare Products, Inc, Kenilworth, NJ) and 64
              oz of Gatorade (PepsiCo, Inc, Purchase, NY) has gained popularity
              as a bowel preparation regimen. However, the efficacy and
              tolerability of this approach has not been compared with standard
              bowel preparations in clinical trials. We compared split-dose
              (PEG) 3350 with electrolytes (GoLytely; Braintree Laboratories,
              Inc, Braintree, MA) with split-dose MiraLAX alone and in
              combination with pretreatment medications (bisacodyl or
              lubiprostone) to determine the efficacy and patient tolerability
              of MiraLAX as an agent for bowel preparation. METHODS: We
              performed a prospective, randomized, blinded, controlled trial at
              a tertiary care center. Patients (n=403) were randomly assigned
              to groups given GoLytely, MiraLAX, MiraLAX with bisacodyl (10
              mg), or MiraLAX with lubiprostone (24 $\mu$g). MiraLAX was
              combined with 64 oz of Gatorade. All patients were surveyed
              regarding preparation satisfaction and tolerability. The Ottawa
              bowel preparation scale was used to grade colon cleanliness.
              RESULTS: GoLytely was more effective at bowel cleansing (average
              Ottawa score, 5.1) than MiraLAX alone (average Ottawa score, 6.9)
              or in combination with lubiprostone (average Ottawa score, 6.8),
              or bisacodyl (average Ottawa score, 6.3) (P<.001). MiraLAX was
              associated with a trend toward longer procedure duration
              (P=.096). Groups given MiraLAX rated the overall experience as
              more satisfactory than those given GoLytely (P<.001). There were
              no differences between polyp detection rates (P=.346) or adverse
              events (P=.823). CONCLUSIONS: Split-dose MiraLAX in 64 oz of
              Gatorade is not as effective as 4 L split-dose GoLytely in bowel
              cleansing for screening colonoscopies.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Those working in healthcare today are challenged more
              than ever before to quickly and efficiently learn from data to
              improve their services and delivery of care. There is broad
              agreement that healthcare professionals working on the front
              lines benefit greatly from the visual display of data presented
              in time order. AIM: To describe the run chart-an analytical tool
              commonly used by professionals in quality improvement but
              underutilised in healthcare. METHODS: A standard approach to the
              construction, use and interpretation of run charts for healthcare
              applications is developed based on the statistical process
              control literature. DISCUSSION: Run charts allow us to understand
              objectively if the changes we make to a process or system over
              time lead to improvements and do so with minimal mathematical
              complexity. This method of analyzing and reporting data is of
              greater value to improvement projects and teams than traditional
              aggregate summary statistics that ignore time order. Because of
              its utility and simplicity, the run chart has wide potential
              application in healthcare for practitioners and decision-makers.
              Run charts also provide the foundation for more sophisticated
              methods of analysis and learning such as Shewhart (control)
              charts and planned experimentation.",

              (3) pilot testing with authors and a public comment period.
              SQUIRE 2.0 emphasizes the reporting of three key components of
              systematic efforts to improve the quality, value, and safety of
              health care: the use of formal and informal theory in planning,
              implementing, and evaluating improvement work; the context in
              which the work is done; and the study of the intervention(s).
              SQUIRE 2.0 is intended for reporting the range of methods used to
              improve health care, recognizing that they can be complex and

              requires effective coordination between healthcare professionals

  abstract  = "In the very early 1900s, there were a few traces of industrial
               engineering thinking being applied to clinical and
               administrative activities in hospitals. These discrete efforts
               did not materialize for several decades until, a little more
               than fifty years ago, when formal use of industrial engineering
               in hospitals first surfaced. The profession appeared as a force
               and coalesced in the 1950s and 1960s. This paper traces the
               evolution of Industrial Engineering in healthcare from its
               beginning through the present with an emphasis on the period
               ending 1989. It discusses the hospital roots of the profession
               that began with emulating the use of IE in manufacturing
               (hospital management engineering) and how it has come to embrace
               various dimensions of healthcare as Health Systems Engineering
               (HSE). The paper's objective is to provide the background of HSE
               which includes discussions of the environmental, governmental,
               and healthcare industry factors that were and remain the impetus
               for growth of the profession; the various ways by which a
               healthcare organization can avail itself of securing Health
               Systems Engineering capabilities; the past and current ways by
               which practitioners enter the HSE field; the professional
               organizations to provide easy networking, career development,
               professional recognition opportunities, and advocacy for the

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Implementation of evidence-based practices often
              requires tailoring implementation strategies to local contextual
              factors, including available resources, expertise, and cultural
              norms. Using an exemplar case, we describe how health systems
              engineering methods can be used to understand system-level
              variation that must be accounted for prior to broad
              implementation. METHODS: Within the context of a single-center
              quality improvement activity, a multi-disciplinary stakeholder
              team used health systems engineering methods to describe how
              pre-endoscopy antithrombotic management was executed, and
              implemented a redesigned process to improve clinical care. The
              research team then conducted multiple stakeholder focus groups at
              four different health-care systems to describe and compare
              current processes for pre-endoscopy antithrombotic medication
              management. Detailed work flow maps for each health-care system
              were developed, analyzed, and integrated to develop an
              overarching current work flow map, identify key process steps,
              and describe areas of process variation. RESULTS: Five key
              process steps were identified across the four health systems: (1)
              place an endoscopy order, (2) screen for antithrombotic use, (3)
              coordinate medication management, (4) instruct the patient, and
              (5) confirm appropriate medication management before procedure.
              Across health systems, we found a high degree of variation in
              each step (e.g., who performed, use of technology, systematic vs.
              ad hoc process). This variation was influenced by two key
              system-level contextual factors: (1) degree of health system
              integration and (2) role and training level of available staff.
              These key steps, areas of variation, and contextual factors were
              integrated into an assessment tool designed to facilitate
              tailoring of a future implementation and dissemination strategy.
              CONCLUSIONS: Tools from health systems engineering can be used to
              identify key work flow process steps, variations in how those
              steps are executed, and influential contextual factors. This
              process and the associated assessment tool may facilitate broader
              implementation tailoring.",

  abstract = "OBJECTIVES: Feasibility of using split-dose bowel preparation in
              an inpatient setting has not been extensively studied. We
              conducted a single-centre multiphase study to (1) understand the
              perceived barriers to split-dose administration among nursing and
              providers, (2) develop and implement a split-dose electronic
              order set and (3) evaluate the use and impact of split-dose
              administration on 100 consecutive colonoscopies. METHODS:
              Nurse/provider interviews were conducted to understand perceived
              concerns and potential barriers to split-dose preparation. Next,
              an order set containing specific nursing instructions was
              developed, disseminated and implemented into the electronic
              health record as the default order set for inpatient
              colonoscopies. Finally, 100 consecutive inpatients undergoing
              colonoscopy were interviewed to determine prep consumption,
              tolerability and rate of procedural delays due to inadequate
              preparation. RESULTS: Survey results indicated perceived concerns
              about inpatients' ability to tolerate and complete the
              preparation, insufficient nursing support and complexity of
              preparation administration. Based on this, prep orders were
              adjusted to accommodate nursing concerns prior to implementation.
              54\% of inpatients actually completed the bowel preparation in
              split doses (SPLIT group); the remainder had the conventional
              full dose preparation (NON-SPLIT). Less procedural delay and a
              lower rate of additional laxatives use (13\% vs 30.4\%) were seen
              in the SPLIT versus NON-SPLIT group. Split-dose preparation was
              well tolerated among inpatients. CONCLUSIONS: Split-dose bowel
              preparation can be implemented for inpatients undergoing
              colonoscopy. This multiphase study demonstrates the steps used to
              implement split-dose preparation at our institution and may

  abstract = "Although adequate bowel preparation is a prerequisite for
              colonoscopy, preparation among inpatients is often suboptimal.
              This study aimed to evaluate the impact of ward nurse education
              on the quality of bowel preparation of inpatients.A prospective,
              double-blinded, non-randomized, controlled study was performed.
              Expert endoscopists provided enhanced education to nurses who
              belonged to an ``educated ward'' followed by training that was
              repeated every week for 1 month. The primary outcome was the
              quality of the bowel preparation, which was based on the Ottawa
              Bowel Preparation Scale (OBPS). Patient compliance and their
              subjective feelings and the factors affecting inadequate bowel
              preparation were also analyzed.One hundred three inpatients in
              the educated ward and 102 patients in the control ward were
              enrolled. Baseline data were comparable between the 2 wards. The
              mean values of the total OBPS scores were 4.42 $\pm$ 2.23 and
              6.15 $\pm$ 2.38 in the educated and control wards, respectively
              (P < 0.001). The rate of poor preparation (OBPS $\geq$ 6) in the
              educated ward was significantly lower than that in the control
              ward (31.1\% vs 58.8\%, P < 0.001). Compliance with preparation
              and diet instructions in the educated ward was superior to that
              in the control ward (P<0.001). Control patients were more likely
              to be anxious before colonoscopy (P < 0.001), whereas patients in
              the educated ward showed higher level of satisfaction (P = 0.001)
              and better sleep quality (P < 0.001). A lack of ward nurse
              education (OR 2.365, P = 0.025), constipation (OR 6.517, P <
              0.001), and insufficient water ingestion (OR 2.044, P = 0.042)
              were independently associated with inadequate bowel preparation
              among inpatients.Ward nurse education effectively improved the
              quality of bowel preparation, and relevant colonoscopic outcomes
              among inpatients. Additional efforts are needed to control
              constipation and to encourage additional water ingestion in
              inpatients for better bowel preparation.",

              hospital, achieving adequate cleansing of the colon is often
              difficult. OBJECTIVES: To assess the impact of patient education,
              in the form of both counselling and written instructions, on
              bowel cleanliness at colonoscopy. METHODS: A total of 38
              inpatients at a tertiary care hospital in Vancouver, British
              Columbia, who were referred to the gastroenterology service for
              colonoscopy were enrolled in the present study. Sixteen patients
              were randomly assigned to the intervention group, while 22
              patients comprised the control group. Both groups received a
              clear liquid diet and 4 L of a commercially available bowel
              preparation. The intervention group also received a brief
              counselling session and written instructions outlining the
              methods and rationale for bowel preparation before colonoscopy.
              Bowel cleanliness was assessed by the endoscopist using a
              five-point rating scale. RESULTS: The two groups were similar
              with respect to demographics, the indication for colonoscopy and
              findings at colonoscopy. The median bowel cleanliness scores in
              the control group and the enhanced-instruction group were 3.0 and

              optimizing colonoscopy preparation in the inpatient setting.",

  abstract = "The aim of this study was to investigate factors contributing to
              poor bowel preparation in patients undergoing colonoscopy
              procedures. We used a reproducible search strategy to identify
              studies, searching 10 medical databases, including PubMed, Ovid,
              Medline, and Cochrane Library Database for reports published
              between 2000 and 2016. Fully published studies, evaluating risk
              factors for inadequate bowel preparation, were included. Two
              reviewers independently scored the identified studies for
              methodology and abstracted pertinent data. Pooling was conducted
              with both fixed-effects and random-effects models; results were
              presented from the random effects model when heterogeneity was
              significant. Odds ratios (OR) estimates with 95\% confidence
              interval were calculated. Heterogeneity was assessed by I
              statistics. Twenty-four studies with a total of 49 868 patients
              met the inclusion criteria. Age (OR: -1.20), male sex (OR: 0.85),
              inpatient status (OR: 0.57), diabetes mellitus (OR: 0.58),
              hypertension (OR: 0.58), cirrhosis (OR: 0.49), narcotic use (OR:
              0.59), constipation (OR: 0.61), stroke (OR; 0.51), and tricyclic
              antidepressant (TCA) use (0.51), were associated with inadequate
              bowel preparation. In our sensitivity analysis comparing Western
              and Asian countries, we found that diabetes, cirrhosis, male sex,
              history of stroke and TCA use were stronger risk factors for
              inadequate bowel preparation in Western countries than in Asian
              countries. We also found that history of stroke, TCA use, and
              race were risk factors for inadequate bowel preparation in
              patients receiving conventional bowel preparation compared with
              those receiving split-dose bowel preparation. Multiple risk
              factors affect the quality of bowel preparation and specific risk
              factors can be intervened upon, in different populations, to
              optimize preparation.",

              complete high-quality colonoscopy. We sought to determine whether
              an inpatient, as opposed to an ambulatory setting, would affect
              the quality of bowel preparation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A
              retrospective chart review was conducted in a tertiary care
              university hospital. We collected demographic data from
              consecutive patients who underwent a colonoscopy for any reason
              between August 2007 and April 2012. RESULTS: A total of 2999
              patients were included in the study with a mean age of 50.36
              (95\%CI; 49.79-50.94). Males comprised 58.12\%. Ambulatory
              patients had a higher rate of good bowel preparations (67.23\%
              vs. 56.64\%, P value < 0.01), a lower rate of poor bowel
              preparations (18.22\% vs. 27.14\%, P value < 0.01), and a higher
              rate of colonoscopy completion (86.79\% vs. 77.59\%, P value <
              0.01). There was no difference between the rates of polyps
              detected (18.90\% vs. 20.83\%, P value = 0.22). The univariabe
              modeling factors associated with a sub-optimal bowel preparation
              were age OR 1.02 (95\% CI, 1.01 to 1.02), chronic kidney disease
              OR 2.34 (95\% CI, 1.12 to 4.88), diabetes mellitus OR 2.00 (95\%
              CI, 1.50 to 2.68), hypertension OR 1.48 (95\% CI, 1.11 to 1.97),
              anemia OR 1.81 (95\% CI, 1.33 to 2.47), and weight loss OR 1.41
              (95\% CI, 1.01 to 1.96). Better bowel preparation was associated
              with colonoscopies performed in the outpatient setting OR 0.63
              (95\% CI, 0.54 to 0.73). CONCLUSION: Bowel preparation quality is
              affected by the setting in which it is performed. This result
              suggests that, when appropriate, colonoscopies should be
              performed on an outpatient basis. Further studies are required to

              poor colonic preparation. A study of 101 inpatients was conducted
              to determine the most effective bowel preparation strategies.
              Results suggest patients on certain medications and with certain
              medical histories react differently to bowel preparation.
              Patients with diabetes, renal disease, chronic obstructive

              aggressive preparation to obtain optimal results. Likewise,

              identified and can be expected to require additional preparation
              to be properly cleansed. Clear liquid diet prior to the
              administration of the bowel preparation was the only diet
              modification that affected quality of preparation. The optimal
              bowel preparation was a 6-liter Golytely preparation along with a
              secondary preparation (e.g., tap water enema, Fleets enema,

  abstract  = "OBJECTIVE: Inadequate preparation of the bowel for colonoscopy
               can result in both missed pathological lesions and cancelled
               procedures. We looked prospectively at the quality of colonic
               preparation and evaluated potential associations between
               specific patient characteristics and inadequate colonic
               preparation. METHODS: Data were gathered on consecutive patients
               presenting for colonoscopy who received either a polyethylene
               glycol lavage or oral sodium phosphate bowel preparation.
               Patient demographic and medical history information was gathered
               before scheduled colonoscopy. The endoscopist evaluated the
               preparation quality during the procedure. Complete data were
               gathered on 649 of 714 eligible patients (90.8\%). Possible
               predictors of inadequate colonic preparation were analyzed using
               univariate statistics and multivariate logistic regression
               models. RESULTS: An inadequate colonic preparation was reported
               in 21.7\% of observed colonoscopies. Only 18\% of patients with
               an inadequate colonic preparation reported a failure to
               adequately follow preparation instructions. A later colonoscopy
               starting time, a reported failure to follow preparation
               instructions, inpatient status, a procedural indication of
               constipation, taking tricyclic antidepressants, male gender, and
               a history of cirrhosis, stroke or dementia were all independent
               predictors of an inadequate colon preparation (all p < 0.05). A
               procedural indication of previous polypectomy was a negative
               predictor of inadequate colonic preparation (p < 0.05).
               CONCLUSION: Several patient characteristics were significantly
               associated with colonic preparation quality independent of
               preparation type, compliance with preparation instructions, and
               procedure starting time. This information may help to identify
               patients at an increased risk for inadequate colonic preparation
               for whom alternative preparation protocols would be appropriate.",

              colonoscopies. In multivariate regression analysis, age greater
              than 60 years [odds ratio (OR) 2.8, 95\% confidence interval (CI)
              1.04-7.4], a history of diabetes (OR 8.6, 95\% CI 6.3-19.4), a
              history of appendectomy (OR 4.6, 95\% CI 2.0-10.5), a history of
              colorectal resection (OR 7.5, 95\% CI 3.4-17.6), and a history of
              hysterectomy (OR 3.4, 95\% CI 1.1-10.4) were independent
              predictors of an inadequate colon preparation. CONCLUSIONS: This
              prospective study identified several factors that may predict
              inadequate polyethylene glycol preparation independent of
              compliance with preparation instructions and procedure starting
              time. This result may help to identify patients at an increased
              risk for inadequate bowel preparation for whom alternative
              preparation protocols would be beneficial.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND/AIMS: Adequate bowel preparation is essential to safe
              and effective inpatient colonoscopy. Predictors of poor inpatient
              colonoscopy preparation and the economic impacts of inadequate
              inpatient preparations are not defined. The aims of this study
              were to (1) determine risk factors for inadequate inpatient bowel
              preparations, and (2) examine the association between inadequate
              inpatient bowel preparation and hospital length of stay (LOS) and
              costs. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of
              adult patients undergoing inpatient colonoscopy preparation over
              12 months (1/1/2013-12/31/2013). RESULTS: Of 524 identified
              patients, 22.3\% had an inadequate preparation. A multiple
              logistic regression model identified the following potential
              predictors of inadequate bowel preparation: lower income (OR
              1.11; 95\% CI 1.04, 1.22), opiate or tricyclic antidepressant
              (TCA) use (OR 1.55; 0.98, 2.46), and afternoon colonoscopy (OR
              1.66; 1.07, 2.59); as well as American Society of
              Anesthesiologists (ASA) class $\geq$3 (OR 1.15; 1.05, 1.25) and
              symptoms of nausea/vomiting (OR 1.14; 1.04, 1.25) when a fair
              preparation was considered inadequate. Inadequate bowel
              preparation was associated with significantly increased hospital
              LOS (model relative mean estimate 1.25; 95\% CI 1.03, 1.51) and
              hospital costs (estimate 1.31; 1.03, 1.67) when compared to
              adequate preparations. CONCLUSIONS: The rate of inadequate
              inpatient bowel preparations is high and associated with a
              significant increase in hospital LOS and costs. We identified
              five potential predictors of inadequate inpatient preparation:
              lower socioeconomic class, opiate/TCA use, afternoon
              colonoscopies, ASA class $\geq$3, and pre-preparation
              nausea/vomiting; these data should guide future initiatives to
              improve the quality of inpatient bowel preparations.",
