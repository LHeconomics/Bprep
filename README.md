# This is the Final Project by Lawrence Hsu

The original paper I am replicating with econ-ark is a paper I published with Aly Strauss back in 2021:
"A patientâ€‘centered framework for health systems engineering in gastroenterology: improving inpatient colonoscopy bowel preparation"

See: https://doi.org/10.1186/s12876-021-01661-4 or search for BMC Gastroenterol (2021) 21:89
